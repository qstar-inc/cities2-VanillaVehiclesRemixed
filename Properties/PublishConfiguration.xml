# Vanilla Vehicles Remixed
What is it? Well, this is a collection of a few vehicles which are repurposed from it's vanilla counterpart.
Repurpose doesn't mean old vehicles are removed. You will still see both variants in game.

As of version 1.0, there are 6 vehicles in this pack.
* Delivery Motorbike (Delivery Vehicle) as **Sports Bike** (Personal Vehicle)
* Pickup (Personal Vehicle) as **Delivery Pickup** (Delivery Vehicle)
* Van (Personal Vehicle) as **Delivery Van** (Delivery Vehicle)
* Prison Van as **Small Delivery Truck** (Delivery Vehicle)
* Evacuation Bus as **Luxury Bus** (Public Transport)
* SUV (Personal Vehicle) as **SUV Taxi** (Taxi)


### SUV Taxi is Yellow. If you want to change color, use **Recolor** or **Vehicle Variations Packs**.
Any more ideas? Find me on Discord.

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed.
* This mod requires ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
